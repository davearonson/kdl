# format: x y direction length sum
# where x and y are coordinates from top left of puzzle
# (1-based; top row & left side are 0, reserved for clue-spaces)
# direction is either - for across or | for down (so it's human-lang indep.)
# length and sum are obvious

2 2 - 2 5
1 3 - 3 7
1 4 - 3 15
1 3 | 2 7
2 2 | 3 7
3 2 | 3 13

# this would result in:
# xxxx
# xxCC
# xC23
# C241
# C519
